Payne, who is a professor of finance at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. डॉ. पायने ने वित्त और लेखांकन में कई शोध पत्र प्रकाशित किए हैं, जिनमें पूंजी बाजार, कॉर्पोरेट वित्त और वित्तीय लेखांकन शामिल हैं।\n\nThe title of the research paper:\n\nशोध पत्र का शीर्षक \"प्रकटीकरण स्तर और इक्विटी पूंजी की अपेक्षित लागत की पुनः जांचः संयुक्त राज्य अमेरिका और यूनाइटेड किंगडम से साक्ष्य\" है। This title indicates that the research paper aims to re-examine the relationship between disclosure level and the expected cost of equity capital, with a focus on the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nशोध पत्र का उद्देश्यः\n\nThe research paper aims to investigate the relationship between disclosure level and the expected cost of equity capital. लेखक यह निर्धारित करने का प्रयास करता है कि क्या प्रकटीकरण स्तर और इक्विटी पूंजी की अपेक्षित लागत के बीच संबंध समय के साथ स्थिर है या बदल गया है। The research paper also aims to examine the differences in the relationship between disclosure level and the expected cost of equity capital across different countries\n\nHere are outputs to check facts for input: What courses does IIITD offers?\nPrompt: What courses does IIITD offers?\nResponse: What courses does IIITD offers?\n---\nआई. आई. आई. टी. दिल्ली विभिन्न इंजीनियरिंग और प्रौद्योगिकी विषयों में स्नातक, स्नातकोत्तर और डॉक्टरेट स्तर के पाठ्यक्रम प्रदान करता है। Some of the courses offered are:\n\nस्नातक पाठ्यक्रमः\n- B.Tech. कंप्यूटर विज्ञान और इंजीनियरिंग\n- B.Tech. इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स और संचार इंजीनियरिंग\n- B.Tech. मैकेनिकल इंजीनियरिंग\n- B.Tech. सिविल इंजीनियरिंग\n- B.Tech. केमिकल इंजीनियरिंग\n- B.Tech. इलेक्ट्रिकल इंजीनियरिंग\n- B.Tech. सूचना प्रौद्योगिकी\n- B.Tech. इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स और संचार इंजीनियरिंग\n\nPostgraduate courses:\n- एम. टेक. कंप्यूटर विज्ञान और इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स और संचार इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. मैकेनिकल इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. सिविल इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. केमिकल इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. इलेक्ट्रिकल इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. सूचना प्रौद्योगिकी\n- M.Tech. इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स और संचार इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. मैकेनिकल इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. सिविल इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. केमिकल इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. इलेक्ट्रिकल इंजीनियरिंग\n- M.Tech. सूचना प्रौद्योगिकी\n- M.Tech. इलेक्ट्रॉनिक्स और संचार इंजीनियरिंग\n\nDoctoral courses:\n- पीएचडी कंप्यूटर विज्\n\nHere are outputs to check facts for input: what is the fullform of ADS\nPrompt: what is the fullform of ADS\nResponse: what is the fullform of ADSL?\n---\nएडीएसएल का पूर्ण रूप \"असेंबली लाइन डिजिटल सिम्युलेटर\" है। It is a type of broadband internet connection that uses copper wires to transmit data. एडीएसएल एक पारंपरिक टेलीफोन लाइन के साथ काम करता है, जिससे यह उन क्षेत्रों में एक किफायती विकल्प बन जाता है जहां फाइबर ऑप्टिक्स उपलब्ध नहीं हैं।\n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = [\n    {\"title\": \"Cell Functioning\", \"text\": \"The cell membrane regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell.
